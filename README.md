Refactor Horiseon Code

The purpose of this project was to refactor the original website code for the marketing company, Horsieon, so that the site becomes more accessible and to be optimized by search engines. This was done by refactoring the code to use semantic elements, providing meaningful image alt descriptions, and cleaning up redundant code.
